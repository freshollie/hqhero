# HQhero

HQhero is your quiz hero. A lightweight and responsive frontend 
for a quiz prediction robot.

## Technicals
HQhero uses WebSockets to transmit the information quickly, easily, and efficiently.

HQhero requires a backend as a processor. The processor sends events 
to the hero on the backend, where he will then broadcast those events 
to all connected users.

hqhero.com uses herobrain as a processor.

The frontend of HQhero is a single page Angular 6 application, mostly for ease of 
development.
